# Time-series-Model
Problem Statement: The aim of project is to forecast number of visitors to Restaurant for next time interval  using TimeSeries model based on previous time intervals data. Dataset: Dataset consist of about 600 records and 8 columns where more than 1 column  corresponds to time order and more than 2 column act as external factor which might  have impact on predicting visitors coming to Restaurant. Technique: I have tried to build SARIMA and SARIMAX model which will take account of exogenous  factor like holiday while forecasting no of visitor for next time interval
